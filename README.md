# Tutorial
### #1 - Craft two portal gate blocks.
This block will place blocks on its sides in a 3x3 area when placed.

### #2 - Craft one rune stone item.
This item is used for copying world ids, and positions and configuring the portal gate.

### #3 - Place one Portal Gate block
Make sure you have enough room for the portal gate.  
The required size of the area must be 3x3x3 to be able to use the portal properly.

### #4 - Set the mode for the Rune Stone.
Make sure the rune stone is in link mode. To change the mode right click on any block that is not the Portal Gate.

#### Rune Stone Modes
1. Link - Will link a portal gate in a single direction.
1. DelayUp - Will increase the portal delay time by 5 ticks.
1. DelayDown - Will decrease the portal delay time by 5 ticks.
1. Monster - Will toggle permission for monsters to use the portal.
1. Creature - Will toggle permission for creatures to use the portal.

### #5 - Right-click the portal gate with the rune stone.
Again make sure your rune stone is in link mode.

### #6 - Place your second portal gate.
You can place your second portal gate in any world or world location. The modification will automatically teleport the entity to that dimension.

### #7 - Link the first portal gate with the second one.
Your rune stone must be in link mode to copy the data over to the second portal gate.  
If it's linked you will see four purple crystals appear.

### #8 - Long Distances and Other Worlds
If you're using other worlds or fare distances that take a bit more time to load than normal chunk loading you may need to adjust the delay time to a higher number.  
  
I suggest custom dimensions or portal gates over the distance of your render distance to have it set to 80 tick delay.
You can increase and decrease this value to fit your performance for your game some computers may take a bit longer to load the world.

### #9 - Preform Step #4 and #5 for the second portal.
Make sure to set the mode for the rune stone back to link mode if you have performed step #8.
Right-click the second portal gate to copy its location.

### #10 - Stand on the second portal gate and wait to teleport to the first portal gate.
You will be now linking up the second portal gate to the first portal gate.

### #11 - Preform Step #7 and #8 for your first portal.
Remember to set the portal delay time for the first portal so you don't get stuck loading worlds and traveling between portals.
